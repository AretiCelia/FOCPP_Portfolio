Python Exercises

The exercises in this logbook demonstrate core Python concepts ranging from basic expressions to data structures, functions, scripts, and modules.


Week 1 – Programming Basics

This exercise covers the fundamentals of programming, including programming language generations, machine code and assembly language, compilers and interpreters, the Python REPL (Read–Eval–Print Loop), integrated development environments (IDEs), and the use of code libraries. It also introduces expressions, operators and operands, operator precedence, runtime, syntax and logical errors, exception messages, and exiting the Python interpreter.



Week 2 – Variables and Data Types

This exercise covers variables and assignment, naming rules and augmented assignment, data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`), dynamic typing, user input and type conversion, strings and escape sequences, lists including indexing, slicing and mutability, and built-in functions such as `type()`, `len()` and `max()`.



 Week 4 – Functions

This exercise covers importing modules and using the Python Standard Library, defining functions using the `def` keyword, writing docstrings, returning values from functions, default arguments, variable-length arguments using `*args` and `**kwargs`, and the use of lambda (anonymous) functions.



Week 5 – Scripts and Modules

This exercise covers writing and executing Python scripts using `.py` files, running scripts from the command line, passing and processing command-line arguments, using the `sys` module and `sys.argv`, creating import aliases, understanding symbol tables, working with module search paths, and using the `__name__ == "__main__"` construct to distinguish between scripts and imported modules.



Week 6 – Lists and Tuples

This exercise covers list methods, iterating over lists, mutator and accessor methods, list comprehensions, tuple creation and immutability, tuple unpacking, indexing tuples, unpacking sequences using the `*` operator, and understanding heterogeneous and homogeneous data structures.


Week 7 – Sets and Dictionaries

This exercise covers sets and their differences from lists, set creation and mutability, the lack of indexing and slicing in sets, frozensets, set comprehensions, and set operations including union, intersection, difference, and subset comparisons. It also covers dictionaries, key–value pairs, dictionary mutability, dictionary constructors, membership testing, iterating over keys and values, dictionary comprehensions, and unpacking dictionaries using the ** operator.

Week 8 – I/O and File Handling

This exercise covers input and output formatting using f-strings, the str.format() method, and percentage-style formatting, including alignment, padding, and numeric precision. It also covers string justification methods, looping for formatted output, and file handling concepts such as files as byte streams, opening and closing files, file modes, reading and writing files, iterating over file contents, file cursor control using tell() and seek(), and safe file handling using the with statement.
